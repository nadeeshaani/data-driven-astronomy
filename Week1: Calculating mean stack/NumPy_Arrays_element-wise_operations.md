- Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays support numerical operations on entire arrays,
    - either as element-wise
    - or matrix operations

- e. g.,
    
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    
    a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    
    # Element-wise multiplication 
    print(a*2)
    
    # Element-wise summation 
    print(a + b)
    
    # Element-wise product 
    print(a*b)
    ```
