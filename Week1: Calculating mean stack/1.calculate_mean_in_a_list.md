## A program to calculate the mean of a set of numbers stored in a Python list

Method 1 -> 
Using `mean` function in `statistics` module in Python.


```python
fluxes = [23.3, 42.1, 2.0, -3.2, 55.6]
m = sum(fluxes)/len(fluxes)
print(m)
```


Method 2 â†’ 
Calculating the mean manually using built-in `sum` and `len` functions.

```python
fluxes = [23.3, 42.1, 2.0, -3.2, 55.6]
m = sum(fluxes)/len(fluxes)
print(m)
```
